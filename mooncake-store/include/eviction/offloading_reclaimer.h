// OffloadingReclaimer: a Reclaimer that keeps an object's data on local disk
// before its memory goes. Layered over the reclaimer that does the releasing:
//
// - An object that already has a completed local-disk replica loses nothing,
//   so its memory goes through the inner reclaimer as it is. One being
//   removed does not count: once its removal is durable it is gone.
// - Otherwise one memory replica the plan names is pinned and queued for
//   offload, and the rest are released now: the data survives through the
//   pinned one, which a later run frees once the copy lands.
// - When no offload can be queued, the object waits for a later run, unless
//   force_evict lets it go without one. With force_evict, a run that has
//   queued `cap` offloads lets the rest go without one too.
