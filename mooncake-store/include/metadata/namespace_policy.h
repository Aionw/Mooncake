// NamespacePolicy: the decisions the metadata core leaves to a policy layered
// on top of it. The core routes and locks the objects of each namespace; a
// policy decides whether a namespace admits a write, whether an object may
// grow, what an object's footprint costs and when a namespace must shed memory
// (multi-tenancy with its quotas is the one policy today), and keeps its own
// state.
//
// The core calls each method at a fixed point and under fixed locks, written
// on the method. One that runs under a key's lock may take only leaf locks: it
// must not reach the core again, take snapshot_mutex_ or client_mutex_, or
// lock another key.
